0. start testing
1. fix parse tree dump format  (prefix literals with "typeof" output; delimit with spaces)
2. add verbosity builtin functions (to RemoteConsole?)
	* dump parse tree
	* dump opcodes
	?  trace VM actions
3. wrap tokens in a "ParseNode" type
	3b. gradually replace them with ParseNode subclasses
	
	This is a refactor that makes the code more readable by providing a uniform, statically typed interface across all token types.
